This lab0-intro-unix will not be graded and there is no credit for it.
However, it is important you understand the Unix command line and sub-
mit procedure before you actually use it in the first assignment.

Make sure you know how to submit files.  Submit these files to lab0.
Verify that the submit actually worked by looking in the submit direc-
tory for your username.  The find(1) command is very useful for things
like this.

The submit command copies your files into a directory
   /afs/cats.ucsc.edu/class/cmps112-wm.f18/lab0/$USER/
and prefixes each file with a sequence number.  You can see the names
of the files, but not their contents.  The submit directory is not ac-
cessible using a web browser.

Prior experience with Unix is assumed.
Attend a lab section to ask questions if you don't understand how sub-
mit and the Unix command line in general works.  The TA can explain
such things.

You may wish to review some of the Unix labs in
   /afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps012b-wm/Labs-cmps012m/
    lab0u-intro-unix/
    lab1u-shells-etc/
    lab2u-utilities-c-make/

Also read the submit checklist:
   /afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps112-wm/Syllabus/submit-checklist/
Write a program in some language and then submit it.  See the submit
checklist to verify what you have submitted.  If you are not sure, at-
tend a lab and ask the TA to verify the submit.

If you choose to do pair programming, carefully read the pair program-
ming guidelines, including details on how to submit a PARTNER file:
   /afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps112-wm/Syllabus/pair-programming/
Points will be deducted for an incorrect PARTNER file.

To make available scripts such as checksource, partnercheck, etc., put
the following in your $PATH environment variable:
   /afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps112-wm/bin/
This can be done with the following bash(1) command:
   export PATH=$PATH:/afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps112-wm/bin

If you put this command in your ~/.bash_profile, it will automatically
be executed every time your log in.  Add similar paths to the exe-
cutable binaries for the various languages we will be using this quar-
ter.  See http://www.linfo.org/path_env_var.html for more information.
If bash(1) is not your login shell, it is recommended that your change
your login shell to bash.  To find out how to do this, log into unix.
ucsc.edu and type the command chsh.

Questions of general interest should be posted to Piazza (https://pi-
azza.com), rather than sent via email, since that usually gets a
faster response.  Use your cruzid@ucsc.edu to log into the Piazza fo-
rum for this class.
